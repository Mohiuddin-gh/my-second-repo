            <h3>About Food</h3>
            <p>Taste is not what you think. Every schoolchild learns that it is one of the five senses, a partner of
                smell and sight and touch, a consequence of food flitting over taste buds that send important
                signals—sweet or bitter, nutrient or poison?—to the brain. Were it so simple. In the past decade our
                understanding of taste and flavor has exploded with revelations of the myriad and complex ways that food
                messes with our consciousness—and of all the ways that our biases filter the taste experience.
                Deliciousness is both ingrained and learned, both personal and universal. It is a product of all five
                senses (hearing included) interacting in unexpected ways, those sensory signals subject to gross
                revision by that clump of nerve tissue we call the brain.</p>

            <h3><span class="color">M</span>ongolian</h3>
            <p>Mongolian cuisine is influenced by the region’s continental climate, as well as Russian and Chinese
                cultures to an extent. This nomadic cuisine’s staple diet consists primarily of meat and dairy, with
                minimal use of vegetables. Horse, yak, beef, lamb, and even camel are all delicacies in Mongolia. If you
                are looking for a flavor burst with spices, you will only get salt and onion.
